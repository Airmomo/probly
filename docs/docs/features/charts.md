# Charts and Visualizations

Probly provides powerful charting capabilities to visualize your spreadsheet data.

## Available Chart Types

- **Bar Charts**: Compare values across categories
- **Line Charts**: Show trends over time or sequences
- **Pie Charts**: Display proportions of a whole
- **Scatter Plots**: Visualize relationships between variables

## Creating Charts

### Using the AI Assistant

The easiest way to create charts is through the AI assistant:

1. Open the AI assistant (Ctrl+Shift+/)
2. Request a chart, for example:
   - "Create a bar chart of monthly sales"
   - "Make a line chart showing temperature trends"
   - "Show me a pie chart of budget allocation"
   - "Generate a scatter plot of height vs. weight"

3. The AI will:
   - Analyze your data to determine appropriate data ranges
   - Generate the requested chart type
   - Position the chart on your spreadsheet

### Chart Management

Once charts are created:

1. **View Charts**: Charts appear as overlays on your spreadsheet
2. **Hide Charts**: Click the "Hide" button on any chart to temporarily hide it
3. **Manage Charts**: Use the Charts button in the toolbar to:
   - See all available charts
   - Show/hide specific charts
   - Delete unwanted charts

## Chart Customization

When requesting charts, you can specify:

- Data ranges to include
- Chart title
- Chart type
- Data series to include

Example: "Create a line chart showing sales for Q1 and Q2 with the title 'Quarterly Sales Comparison'"

## Technical Details

Charts in Probly are powered by ECharts, a powerful charting library that provides:

- Interactive charts
- Responsive design
- Multiple chart types
- Customization options

## Chart Data

When a chart is created, the AI:

1. Analyzes your spreadsheet data
2. Determines appropriate data series and labels
3. Formats the data for visualization
4. Creates a chart configuration

The chart data remains linked to your original spreadsheet data, but changes to the spreadsheet after chart creation won't automatically update the chart.
